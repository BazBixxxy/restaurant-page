Simply designed restaurant page

Prending improvement:
> design an about us page
> design an admin portal where the owners of the restuarant can add food items
> make the menu real
> link the food sections on the homepage to their adjacent menu
> make the rest of the other buttons in the header functional

Issue:
> the javascript needs alot of work:
* the javascript is not rendering the contents of the webpage properly for example it cannot read the event listeners on the pages it renders
